React Universal
===============

This is an implementation of the code presented in the
[Universal React](https://24ways.org/2015/universal-react) article by
[Jack Franklin](https://github.com/jackfranklin). Apart from some
minor differences (e.g., using Gulp instead of Webpack) it's identical to the
code published [here](http://github.com/jackfranklin/universal-react-example).


Installation:
=============

```
$ npm i
```

This will ask for your root password in order to install
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).


Running:
=======

```
$ npm start
```

Now you can navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to test the
application.
